Alfred Workflow scripts

What this Alfred workflow does
-----------------------
Tasks2Boss will send tasks from the "Due Soon" Perspective in Omnifocus2 to your manager via Microsoft Outlook. 

Suggestions for creating a Due Soon Perspective found here: https://discourse.omnigroup.com/t/how-to-create-a-due-perspective/192/2

The body of the email will be formatted as a table and include:

- Task name
- Due Date
- Estimated time (in hours)
- Grand total of estimated hours

Doing this weekly shows your boss just how overwhelmed you are, or conversely, that you are available to take on more.

One UI requirement you will have to perform for the estimated time script to work is selecting all the tasks from the Due Soon Perspective. Select one task, then CMD + A. Omnifocus2 will remember that selection even when the program closes.
